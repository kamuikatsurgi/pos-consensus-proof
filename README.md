### Background

Polygon PoS contains 2 layers â€” bor (execution layer based on geth/erigon) and heimdall (consensus layer based on tendermint). Polygon is also building [AggLayer](https://github.com/agglayer), which expects each chain to generate a ZK proof with different security assumptions. A full execution proof is practically infeasible with a 2s block time for PoS. Hence, as an excercise to plug PoS into AggLayer, we rely on consensus proofs.

### Proving Consensus

Consensus proofs asserts that the majority (>2/3) of PoS validator set agree on a specific state of chain. This allows an external layer (e.g. AggLayer) to verify that the chain is operating honestly assuming the majority validator set is honest. To elaoborate a bit more, the specific state of chain here means a particular state of the execution layer. This is achieved using milestones, which is a also used for finality in PoS. Milestones are messages which are proposed in heimdall representing a range of bor blocks and is being voted upon and persisted. While there is more nuance to it, at a high level consensus proofs basically validates if majority of validators voted upon / signed a milestone message through signature verification.

### Repository Overview

This repositories is organised into the following directories:
- `consensus-proof`: Contains the ZK circuit of verifying a milestone message and respective helper functions.
- `operator`: Implementation of an operator which assembles inputs used to generate the proof.
- `common`: Contains generic global types.
- `contracts`: The solidity contracts for on-chain verification and fetching validator set data.

### Proof Generation

Make sure you've [Rust](https://rustup.rs/) and [SP1](https://docs.succinct.xyz/docs/getting-started/install) installed.

Using the `operator` service, one can generate consensus proofs for any PoS chain given appropriate configurations are provided. Below are the steps to do the same.

1. Create an environment file using the example. Fill in all relevant details which will be used for assembling the inputs. It needs information about L1 (eth mainnet / sepolia), PoS endpoints (mainnet / amoy for heimdall and bor).
    ```sh
    cp .env.example .env
    ```
2. Make sure you're able to build the operator.
    ```sh
    cd operator
    cargo build
    ```
3. Run the operator service
    ```sh
    RUST_LOG=info cargo run --release -- --milestone_id <id> --milestone_hash <hash> --prev_l2_block_number <hash> --new_l2_block_number <number> --proof_type <plonk/compressed> --prove
    ```
    Going forward, the initial flags about milestone and block number will be internalised in the operator service itself so that it auto picks up these values. One can generate PLONK and compressed proofs by specifying it in the `proof_type` flag. If you just want to execute, remove the `--prove` flag.
4. Operator also has some helper commands.
    ```sh
    # To print the vkey
    RUST_LOG=info cargo run --release --bin vkey

    # To verify the proof generated
    RUST_LOG=info cargo run --release --bin verify
    ```

If you want to use the SP1 prover network, set the `SP1_PROVER` env variable to `network` and set the `SP1_PRIVATE_KEY` environment variable to your whitelisted private key. For more information, see the [setup guide](https://docs.succinct.xyz/docs/generating-proofs/prover-network).
